     * 1. Abstraction     - The language must provide a way to manage complex problems by allowing you to abstract
     *                      or identify the objects involved in the problem. 
     * 2. Encapsulation   - The language must provide support for packaging data attributes and behaviors into a
     *                      single unit, thus hiding implementation details. 
     * 3. Inheritance     - The language must provide features that enable reuse of code through extending the 
     *                      functionality of the program units. 
     * 4. Polymorphism    - The language must enable multiple implementations of the same behaviors so that the
     *                      appropriate implementation can be executed based on the situation.
