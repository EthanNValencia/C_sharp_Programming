 * 1. Consistency       - Try to follow design traditions. Ex: X in the upper right corner 
 *                        exits the program, save is in the file menu. Sizing items consistently
 *                        is also important. Items that provide the same functionality should
 *                        be in the same area on the GUI.
 *                        
 * 2. Alignment         - Place similar items together and align them so that they stand on 
 *                        on the same axis. Use blank space as a way of defining groups. 
 *                        Align controls with their labels.
 *                        
 * 3. Avoid Clutter     - Try not use too many things in a GUI. If possible, recycle the functionality
 *                        of controls. Controls should be large enough to use. Everything should be 
 *                        legible, but not overly large. 
 *                        
 * 4. Color             - Colors should contrast with each other. Avoid bright colors, because they 
 *                        can result in eye fatigue. At times, using color can be helpful, but be 
 *                        mindful to not abuse it. 
 *                        
 * 5. Target Audience   - Let the nature of the target audience influence GUI design decisions. 
 *                        Additionally, consider where the application will be displayed. What
 *                        is your Target Device? Is it web-, mobile-, or desktop-based?
