 * When developing an ASP.NET web application, there are two main files.
 * One of the files houses the HTML and the other file contains the logic.
 * The HTML file is referred to as the "Web Forms page".
 * The logic file is referred to as the "code-behind file".
 * 
 * The HTML/Web Forms page contains static HTML tags and any ASP.NET server
 * controls that have been added to the application. 
 * 
 * The logic/code-behind file residents in a seperate file. All the event handler
 * methods are stored in this code-behind file. This file contains the code that 
 * enables the user to interact with the page.
